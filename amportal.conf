AMPEXTENSIONS=extensions

# ENABLECW: Enable call waiting by default when an extension is created (DEFAULT is yes)
# Set to 'no' to if you don't want phones to be commissioned with call waiting already
# enabled. The user would then be required to dial the CW feature code (*70 default) to 
# enable their phone. Most installations should leave this alone. It allows multi-line
# phones to receive multiple calls on their line appearances.
ENABLECW=yes

#CWINUSEBUSY: Set to yes for extensions that have CW enabled to report as busy if
# they don't answer (resulting in busy voicemail greeting). Otherwise they simply
# report as no-answer (e.g. busy greeting servers no purpose
CWINUSEBUSY=yes

# AMPBADNUMBER: Set to false if you do not want the bad-number context generated which
# traps any bogus number or freature code and plays a message to the effect. If you use
# the Early Dial feature on some Grandstream phones, you will want to set this to false
AMPBADNUMBER=true

# The following are used to optionally have the freepbx backup program optionally
# send the generated backup to an ftp server
#
# FTPBACKUP=YES to enable
# FTPUSER, FTPPASSWORD, FTPSERVER must be set
# FTPSUBDIR is an optional subdirectory at the ftp server, it will cause ftp to do a cd
#
# There is no error checking so you should check to make sure these are set correctly. The
# ftp is saved after the backup, so it will not cause the local backup file to be effected
#
# FTPBACKUP=yes
#FTPUSER=asterisk
#FTPPASSWORD=password
#FTPSUBDIR=mybackupfolder
#FTPSERVER=myftpserver

# SSH BACKUP INFO: must have a valid SSHRSAKEY file and server, only supported through
# ssh. SUBDIR is optional and will be created if it does not exist.
#
# If SSHUSER is not set, it will default to the current user which is asterisk in any
# standard configuration.
#
#SSHBACKUP=yes
#SSHUSER=backups
#SSHRSAKEY=/etc/asterisk/backup_rsa
#SSHSUBDIR=mysubdir
#SSHSERVER=mybackupserver.com

# AMPPROVROOT=/var/ftp /tftpboot
# One or more directories where there are provisioning files that should be included in the backup. Currently
# these get backed up only, the FreePBX utility does not automatically restore them.
#
#AMPPROVROOT=/var/ftp /tftpboot
# AMPPROVEXCLUDE=/var/ftp/exclude-from-file-list
# a list of files to exclude, to be used in tar's --exclude-from argument
#
#AMPPROVEXCLUDE=/var/ftp/exclude-from-file-list

# If CUSTOMASERROR is set to false, then the Destination Registry will not report unknow destinations as errors
# this should be left to the default true and custom destinations should be moved into the new custom apps registry
# CUSTOMASERROR=false

# if DYNAMICHINTS is set to true, Core will not statically generate hints. Instead it will make a call to the
# AMPBIN php script, generate_hints.php, through an Asteirsk's #exec call. This requires Asterisk.conf to be
# configured with "execincludes=yes" set in the [options] section.
# DYNAMICHINTS=true

# XTNCONFLICTABORT, BADDESTABORT
# setting either of these to true will result in retrieve_conf aborting during a reload if an extension
# conflict is detected or a destination is detected. It is usually better to allow the reload to go
# through and then correct the problem but these can be set if a more strict behavior is desired
# both default to false if not set
XTNCONFLICTABORT=false
BADDESTABORT=false

# SERVERINTITLE if set to true, the browser title will be preceded with the server name. default false
SERVERINTITLE=false

# USEDEVSTATE = true|false # DEFAULT VALUE false
# If this is set, it assumes that you are running Asterisk 1.4 or higher and want to take advantage of the
# func_devstate.c backport available from Asterisk 1.6 which allows custom hints to be created to support
# BLF for server side feature codes such as daynight, followme, etc.
#
USEDEVSTATE=true

# MODULEADMINWGET=true|false # DEFAULT VALUE false
# Module Admin normally tries to get its online information through direct file open type calls to URLs that
# go back to the freepbx.org server. If it fails, typically because of content filters in firewalls that don't
# like the way PHP formats the requests, the code will fall back and try a wget to pull the information.
# This will often solve the problem. However, in such environemnts there can be a significant timeout before
# the failed file open calls to the URLs return and there are often 2-3 of these that occur. Setting this value
# will force FreePBX to avoid the attempt to open the URL and go straight to the wget calls.
#
MODULEADMINWGET=false

# AMPDISABLELOG=true|false # DEFAULT VALUE true
# Whether or not to invoke the freepbx log facility

# AMPSYSLOGLEVEL=LOG_EMERG|LOG_ALERT|LOG_CRIT|LOG_ERR|LOG_WARNING|LOG_NOTICE|LOG_INFO|LOG_DEBUG|LOG_SQL|SQL # DEFAULT VALUE LOG_ERR
# Where to log if enabled, SQL, LOG_SQL logs to old MySQL table, others are passed to syslog system to determine where to log

# AMPENABLEDEVELDEBUG=true|false # DEFAULT VALUE false
# Whether or not to include log messages marked as 'devel-debug' in the log system

AMPMPG123=true
# When set to false, the old MoH behavior is adopted where MP3 files can be loaded and WAV files converted to MP3
# The new default behavior assumes you have mpg123 loaded as well as sox and will convert MP3 files to WAV. This is
# highly recommended as MP3 files heavily tax the system and can cause instability on a busy phone system.

# CDR DB Settings: Only used if you dont use the default values provided by freepbx.
# CDRDBHOST: hostname of db server if not the same as AMPDBHOST
# CDRDBPORT: Port number for db host 
# CDRDBUSER: username to connect to db with if its not the same as AMPDBUSER
# CDRDBPASS: password for connecting to db if its not the same as AMPDBPASS
# CDRDBNAME: name of database used for cdr records
# CDRDBTYPE: mysql or postgres mysql is default
# CDRDBTABLENAME: Name of the table in the db where the cdr is stored cdr is default 

# AMPVMUMASK: defaults to 077 allowing only the asterisk user to have any permissions on VM files. If set to something
#             like 007, it would allow the group to have permissions. This can be used if setting apache to a different
#             user then asterisk, so that the apache user (and thus ARI) can have access to read/write/delete the
#             voicemail files. If changed, some of the voicemail directory strucuters may have to be manually changed.

# DASHBOARD_STATS_UPDATE_TIME=integer_seconds
# DEFAULT VALUE: 6
# DASHBOARD_INFO_UPDATE_TIME=integer_seconds
# DEFAULT VALUE: 20
# These can be used to change the refresh rate of the System Status Panel. Most of
# the stats are updated based on the STATS interval but a few items are checked
# less frequently (such as Astersisk Uptime) based on the INFO value

# FOPDISABLE=true|false # DEFAULT VALUE false
# Disables FOP in interface and retrieve_conf.  Usefull for sqlite3 or if you don't want FOP.

ZAP2DAHDICOMPAT=true
# DEFAULT VALUE: false
# If set to true, FreePBX will check if you have chan_dadhi installed. If so, it will
# automatically use all your ZAP configuration settings (devices and trunks) and
# silently convert them, under the covers, to DAHDI so no changes are needed. The
# GUI will continue to refer to these as ZAP but it will use the proper DAHDI channels.
# This will also keep Zap Channel DIDs working.
